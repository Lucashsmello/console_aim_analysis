# console_aim_analysis
A software for collecting data with respect to angular speed for each joystick input of PS4 fps games.
It uses a video capture card, GIMX and a simple image comparison algorithm.
This software has only been tested on Windows 10, because my cheap pci video capture card does not have drivers on Linux.
